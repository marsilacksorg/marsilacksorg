# Hello, I'm Marsilacks!

### just a guy that likes Jesus Chirst and coding

I've been modding, messing with, and breaking things in games since *2023* just to see what games have beyond there coding.

*I play games with no cheats/mods too but I find modding them and pushing them to their limits is fun*


### languages I'm learing
- C#
- Python
- C++
- HTML
